Analyze single family properties relative to their HOA guidelines

Investing in single family properties can be a challenge. Listing data on websites like zillow don't provide
information about covenants, conditions, and restrictions i.e CCRs for HOAs. This makes it much more tedious to find
poperties that may be investable.

This project will allow a user to see listed properties along with with the CCR data and other important data points 
that would help inform if the property is likely to be a good non-owner occupied rental.
